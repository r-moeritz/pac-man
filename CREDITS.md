* Most of the code, as well as the maze sprites, are from
  [pacmancode.com](https://pacmancode.com), whose author appears to
  wish to remain anonymous.
* All other sprites are from
  [here](https://labs.phaser.io/assets/games/pacman/sprites32.png). Apologies,
  but I can't figure out who created this spritesheet.
* The sounds are from
  [sounds-resource.com](https://www.sounds-resource.com/arcade/pacman/sound/10603/).
* The font used is [Press Start 2P](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Press+Start+2P/about) by Cody "CodeMan38" Boisclair.
* The information about the mechanics of Pac-Man was gleaned from [The Pac-Man Dossier](https://pacman.holenet.info) by Jamey Pittman.
